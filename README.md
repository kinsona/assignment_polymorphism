=======================

Cheer time! When I say "Poly", you say "Morphic", "Gon", "Vore", "Glot" or whatever your receiver returns!



Terrible Songwriting Program!

Child: Chorus
- always follows another part of the song
  (only an idiot would start with the chorus)

Parent 1: Intro
Parent 2: Verse
Parent 3: Bridge
Parent 4: 80's guitar solo

Parent objects will be referred to as "lead_ins," because they can (but don't have to) lead into a chorus.  The fields will be named lead_in_type and lead_in_id.
